Time is the one resource we can't get back.

But the truth about time management is that it's not about squeezing more tasks into your day.

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's about making better choices with the time you have.

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Prioritize the activities that matter most and let go of distractions.

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Time management is about focus, not multitasking.

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The more focused you are, the more you can accomplish in less time.

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
